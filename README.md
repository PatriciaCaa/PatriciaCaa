### Hello there 👋 

I am Patricia, an MSc Bioinformatics graduate with a background in Biomedical Science. 
I enjoy learning new coding languages. I am passionate about using computational resources to solve biological problems.

💞️ I am eager to contribute to projects and roles to advance scientific understanding, healthcare outcomes, and general data analysis.
💻 Technically proficient in Linux environments, R, Python, BASH scripting and HPC.

🧬 I am particularly proud of my master's project where I focused on the origin, duplication, and identification of opsin genes in vertebrates, 
developing skills in creating phylogenetic trees and single-cell RNA sequence analysis.
